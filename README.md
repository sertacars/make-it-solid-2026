# Make it solid — building software with care in 2026

This repository documents my focus on building solid, maintainable, and production-ready software throughout 2026.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build real-world, production-quality software
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and performance
- Learn in public and improve deliberately
- Prepare for international engineering opportunities

## 🛠 Focus Areas
- Frontend engineering (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- Backend fundamentals (Node.js, APIs, databases)
- System boundaries & data flow
- Performance, scalability, and real-world constraints
- Clean architecture and refactoring

## 🧭 Scope & Direction

My focus is not on being “full-stack” by title,  
but on understanding and owning the system end to end.

- Frontend is my strength and primary interface to users
- Backend is a responsibility, not a black box
- I aim to design clear boundaries between client, server, and data

### Tech Scope 2026
- Frontend: React, Next.js
- Backend: Node.js, REST APIs
- Data: relational DB fundamentals
- Auth & security basics
- Deployment awareness

## 🧠 Philosophy
Fast is good. Solid is better.

## 📐 System Thinking
Scenarios in this repository describe system design decisions before implementation.
